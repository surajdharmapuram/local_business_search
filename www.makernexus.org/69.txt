This final phase will allow us to:
Power up critical equipment like the surface grinder, vacuum former, and injection molder.
Enhance the efficiency of our welders with additional 220V outlets.
Dedicate a transformer for the plasma cutter.
Bring power to our front tables, completing our vision.
Add new equipment and enhance our space.
