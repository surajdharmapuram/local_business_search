For more information about Maker Nexus check out our Wiki. It covers tools, tips, techinques, fabrication, making, crafting and a bit of hacking.  Frankly, we set it up so that we wouldn't forget all the good things we have learned through hard work and getting help from our friends. Everyone is welcome to use our information.
